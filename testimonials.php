										<p>I have been involved in Joomla since of time of Mambo and have never posted a review here. But this is something that you will not find anywhere. No book, no classes , no custom devs , no PAID devs can make it so easy for you to start your new Joomla extension. Celeb, you are a real Joomla star coder! JCommunity should push you all the way to the top. THANK YOU!</p>

										<p>This free tool makes life so much easier for both the expert and beginner. If like myself you wish to try and create your own component ? then this is or you.</p>
										<p>Simple yet the thought behind it is beyond .....</p>
										<p>I have always thought that creating a component was beyond my reach, however with this tool, as a beginner to help with all the basic's and ensure you have the best start, this is the best. If you are thinking of designing your own component and looking for the best designed structured layout then look no further. As a novice I pointed out a few simple issues, ( my fault for not looking for into the MVC structure) and got replies from the developer straight away.</p>
										<p>This tool is a must for all persons trying to create components & modules and have a base template from which to work from.</p>
										<p>For me well worth the extra few euros for a paid subscription.</p>
										<p>Thanks Caleb for making this free for us :-)</p>

										<p>This extension has just saved me so much time, I couldn't help but pay the small price to have access to the components manager.</p>
										<p>I've been using Joomla for several years and have even created several components for my own use, but this component just did for me in five minutes what I have spent days doing previously.</p>
										<p>The developer is still working at bringing new features and responded immediately to my emails.</p>
										<p>I am genuinely excited to see what this component will be able to create, and I look forward to my future with Joomla as this has just made my life so much easier!</p>

										<h5>Amazing tool with an A+ developer</h5>

										<p>I have a basic understanding of MVC and developing for Joomla! and am working to expand my knowledge by working on custom components and exploring the Joomla! environment. If you have ever tried to flip through the Joomla! documentation and learn something as integral and writing a component from scratch and all the nuances that come with that then you will know how I felt when I said I was about ready to give up. It is a rabbit hole minefield.</p>
										<p>Then i discouvered Calebs Black Rabbit Joomla! component creator and things suddenly started making sense. His wizard is a joy to use and walks you through the basics of setting up a component without the need to manually set up the structure time and time again. It then spits out a 100% functional installable component that you can build on from there...what more could you possibly ask for.</p>
										<p>The developer Caleb is prompt answering questions, and is working on and developing the tool actively. I emailed him feedback with an issue I discovered and I had an email from him within an hour acknowledging the issue, and it was fixed later that night...I don't know about you - but that is impressive.</p>
										<p>I do not normally write reviews - but I just had to for this one...a no-brainer for anyone thinking about making a component of their own, novice to advanced it will save you time and headache! Do yourself a favour and try it!</p>
